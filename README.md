Fashion Images Classification using the Deep Learning Techniques(Convolution Neural Network).
In this machine learning project, the central focus is on tackling the classification challenge presented by the Fashion MNIST dataset. Motivated by the 
growing importance of image classification in various industries, particularly in the realm of fashion, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and 
efficiency of categorizing clothing items. The paper makes notable contributions by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model enriched 
with advanced techniques, including transfer learning and data augmentation. The literature review underscores the significance of image classification 
and the existing methods employed in similar tasks. Despite the advancements, a research gap is identified in achieving optimal accuracy and 
generalization for fashion item classification, prompting the project to introduce a novel approach that addresses this gap and demonstrates superior 
performance compared to existing methods
